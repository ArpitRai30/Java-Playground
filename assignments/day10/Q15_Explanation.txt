Answer to Question 15:

(a) For three clients connecting almost simultaneously, the server accepts each connection and typically creates three Socket objects on the server side—one per accepted connection. The ServerSocket itself is separate.

(b) Life cycle:
 1. ServerSocket listens on port 8080.
 2. Client connects -> ServerSocket.accept() returns a new Socket for that connection.
 3. Server spawns a handler (thread or task) to service that Socket.
 4. Server and client exchange data using InputStream/OutputStream.
 5. When communication finishes, both sides close their sockets; the server's handler terminates.

Note: Many servers pool threads or use non-blocking IO, but the logical lifecycle is the same.
